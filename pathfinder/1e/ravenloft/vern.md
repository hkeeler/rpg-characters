## Items

### On Character

- +2 [Full Plate Armor](https://www.aonprd.com/EquipmentArmorDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Full%20plate) with [Slick](https://www.aonprd.com/MagicArmorDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Slick)

    This metal suit comprises multiple pieces of interconnected and overlaying metal plates, incorporating the benefits of numerous types of lesser armor. A complete suit of full plate (or platemail, as it is often called) includes gauntlets, heavy leather boots, a visored helmet, and a thick layer of padding that is worn underneath the armor. Each suit of full plate must be individually fitted to its owner by a master armorsmith, although a captured suit can be resized to fit a new owner at a cost of 200 to 800 (2d4  100) gold pieces.
    - Cost 1,500 gp Weight 50 lbs.
    - Armor Bonus +9; Max Dex Bonus +1; Armor Check Penalty -6
    - Arcane Spell Failure Chance 35%; Speed 20 ft./15 ft.
- +2 [Elven Curve Blade](https://www.aonprd.com/EquipmentWeaponsDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Elven%20curve%20blade) of Thundering
    - +3 = 9,000 GP

    Essentially a longer version of a scimitar, but with a thinner blade, the elven curve blade is exceptionally rare. You receive a +2 circumstance bonus to your CMD whenever a foe attempts to sunder your elven curve blade because of its flexible metal.

    - Cost 80 gp Weight 7 lbs.
    - Damage 1d8 (small), 1d10 (medium); Critical 18-20/x2; Range —; Type S; Special —
    - Category Two-Handed; Proficiency Exotic

        - Coated at all times with a slightly greasy oil.
        - +5 competence bonus on its wearer’s Escape Artist checks.
        - The armor’s armor check penalty still applies normally.

You can use the Weapon Finesse feat to apply your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier on attack rolls with an elven curve blade that is sized for you, even though it isn’t a light weapon.

### Other Items

- **Elixir of Fire Breath:** This strange bubbling elixir bestows upon the drinker the ability to spit gouts of flame. He can breathe fire up to three times, each time dealing 4d6 points of fire damage to a single target up to 25 feet away. The target can attempt a DC 13 Reflex save for half damage. Unused blasts of fire dissipate 1 hour after the liquid is consumed. 
- **Horn of Fog:** This small bugle allows its possessor to blow forth a thick cloud of heavy fog similar to that of an obscuring mist spell. The fog covers a 10-foot square next to the horn blower each round that the user continues to blow the horn; a fog cloud travels 10 feet each round in a straight line from the emanation point unless blocked by something substantial such as a wall. The device makes a deep, foghorn-like noise, with the note dropping abruptly to a lower register at the end of each blast. The fog dissipates after 3 minutes. A moderate wind (11+ mph) disperses the fog in 4 rounds; a strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the fog in 1 round.
