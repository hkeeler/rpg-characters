### Skills

#### Perception (WIS)

Your Wisdom (Perception) check lets you spot, hear, or otherwise detect the
presence of something. It measures your general awareness of your surroundings
and the keenness of your senses. For example, you might try to hear a conversation
through a closed door, eavesdrop under an open window, or hear monsters moving
stealthily in the forest. Or you might try to spot things that are obscured or
easy to miss, whether they are orcs lying in ambush on a road, thugs hiding in
the shadows of an alley, or candlelight under a closed secret door. 


### Feats

#### Savage Attacker

Once per turn when you roll damage for a melee weapon attack, you can reroll
the weapon's damage dice and use either total.
