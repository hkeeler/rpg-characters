## Feats

- **Alert** (Variant Human bonus feat at 1): +5 Initiative; can’t be surprised while conscious.  

## Class Features - War Magic Wizard
### Arcane Deflection
When you are hit by an attack or you fail a saving throw, you can use your reaction to gain a +2 bonus to your AC against that attack or a +4 bonus to that saving throw.

When you use this feature, you can't cast spells other than cantrips until the end of your next turn.

### Tactical Wit
You can add your INT mod (+5) to your initiative rolls.

### Power Surge
You can store magical energy within yourself to later empower your damaging spells.

Store a maximum number of power surges equal to your INT mod (+5). Whenever you finish a long rest, your number of power surges resets to one. Whenever you successfully end a spell with **Dispel Magic** or **Counterspell**, you gain one power surge, as you steal magic from the spell you foiled. If you end a short rest with no power surges, you gain one power surge.

Once per turn when you deal damage to a creature or object with a wizard spell, you can spend one power surge to deal extra force damage to that target. The extra damage equals half your wizard level.

### Durable Magic
While you maintain **Concentration** on a spell, you have a **+2 bonus to AC and all saving throws**.
