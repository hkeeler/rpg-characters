## Tactics (PvP/FFA)

- **Pre-fight:** *Mage Armor*; *Find Familiar* (owl) if allowed.  
- **Round 1:** Usually win init.  
  - **Casters cluster:** *Wall of Force* a section and hold **Counterspell**.  
  - **Going to be focused:** *Greater Invisibility* and kite.  
  - **Big scrum:** *Hypnotic Pattern* from cover.

### Animate Objects — Finisher Plan
- **Default swarm:** **10 Tiny** → **10 attacks/round**, **+8 to hit**, **1d4+4** each.  
- **Focus fire order:** “All of you: attack **that** target.” They obey until you change the order.  
- **DPR guide (no adv):** vs AC 16 ≈ **42 DPR**; AC 18 ≈ **36**; AC 20 ≈ **29**.  
- **Spread vs AoE:** Don’t clump; stagger pairs.  
- **Body-block:** Surround to trap and force OAs.  
- **War Wizard synergy:** **Durable Magic** (+2 AC/saves) while concentrating; **Arcane Deflection** to salvage failed Con saves (cantrip-only next turn is fine—the swarm still attacks).
